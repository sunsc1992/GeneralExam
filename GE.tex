\section{Introduction}

Electronic and nuclear motion are fundamental to our understanding of chemical
and physical phenomena. From electronic reorganization upon photoinduced charge
transfer in the chromophores of solar cells to the ultrafast excitonic dynamics
in nanocrystalline materials, molecular dynamics lies at the heart of chemistry.
As such, to properly model these phenomena theoretically, we must often venture
into the time-domain to capture the physics necessary to completely understand
the problem at hand. As such, this task constitutes a primary focus of modern
\emph{ab initio} quantum molecular theory.

In the quantum mechanical description of molecular systems, neglecting explicit
coupling to a quantized photon field, time evolution of the total molecular wave
function, $\ket{\Psi (t)}$ is governed by the wave equation (in atomic units),
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{H}(t) \ket{\Psi (t)} = i\partial_t \ket{\Psi(t)} \quad,
\label{eq:WaveEq}
\end{equation}
where $\mathscr{H}(t)$ is the time--dependant Hamiltonian and $\partial_t$ is a
partial derivative with respect to time, and $t$ is a time variable. We have
adopted the standard descripton of the wave function as a state vector rather
than an explicit function of coordiates. The moieties inclosed in parantheses
are taken to be parameters, i.e. the wave function is parameterized by time.
one may formally decompose $\ket{\Psi (t)}$ into a product of nuclear and
electronic wave functions,
\begin{equation} 
\ket{\Psi (t)} = \ket{\Phi(\vc{R},t)}\otimes\ket{\Theta(t)} 
\quad .  
\label{eq:exactSepElecNuc}
\end{equation} 

%Here, $\vc{r}$ and $\vc{R}$ are the electronic and nuclear coordinates
%respectively, $t$ is a time parameter, and $\Phi(\vc{r} \vert \vc{R}, t)$ and
%$\Theta(\vc{r} \vert t)$ are the time--dependent electronic and nuclear wave
%functions respectively. The vertical separator found in the parameters of the
%above wave functions are used to denote a parametric time dependence of the
%function on those parameters that appear to the right of the separator. 
Here, $\ket{\Phi(\vc{R},t)}$ and $\ket{\Theta (t)}$ are the electronic and
nuclear wave functions respectively and $\vc{R}$ is the expectation value of the
nuclear position operator, $\vc{R} = \innerop{\Theta (t)}{\hat{\vc{R}}}{\Theta
(t)}$.  It should be noted that the separation of the total molecular wave
function in \cref{eq:exactSepElecNuc} is formally exact\cite{Gross10_PRL123002,
Cederbaum08_JCP124101} without loss of generality in the non-relativistic
treatment of quantum mechanics. Even so, the equations of motion for the time
dependence of \cref{eq:exactSepElecNuc} are wildly complicated\cite{Ghosh15_MP1}
and would only be pratical for molecules consisting of a few atoms.
Nevertheless, this explicitly exact treatment allows one to, in principle,
bifurcate the treatment of quantum molecular dynamics into explicit treatment of
the electronic and nuclear time dependence separately. Thus, in order to
theoretically treat molecular dynamics accurately, one must be able to treat
both the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom to some level of accuracy.
This separation will be the underlying principle of the future directions that I
propose in this work.

Over the years, perhaps the most successful \emph{ab initio} treatment of the
electronic degrees of freedom of the total eave function has been in the
configuration interaction (CI) expansion of the electronic wave function. In the
CI expansion, the total exact electronic wave function is written as a linear
combination of Slater determinants,
\begin{equation}
\ket{\Phi (\vc{R},t)} = \sum_i c_i(t) \ket{\psi_i (\vc{R},t)}
\quad ,
\label{eq:CIExp}
\end{equation}
where $\left\lbrace\ket{\psi_i}\right\rbrace$ is a set of Slater determinantal
electronic wave functions and $\left\lbrace c_i \right\rbrace$ is a set of
expansion coefficients. We have now moved to an abstract vector space definition
of the electronic wave function which we will maintain unless explicitly stated
otherwise. In principle, the above expansion is exact given that all possibile
electronic configurations are included. Given that each of the Slater
determinants is written as a linear combintation of single particle Fock states,
$\left\lbrace \phi_p \right\rbrace$, hereafter referred to as \emph{molecular
orbitals}, there are a total of $\mathcal{C}(N,K)$ possible determinants that
would need to be included in the expansion, where $N$ and $K$ are the total
number of electrons and the number of molecular orbitals in 
$\left\lbrace \phi_p \right\rbrace$. Such an exhaustive expansion is called
\emph{full configuration interaction} (FCI) and is rendered impractical for the
majority of systems due to the rapid growth of the total number of required
Slater determinants.

In practice, we as theoriticians must restrict which Slater determinants we
include in \cref{eq:CIExp}. As a result, a vast proportion of research in the
field of electronic structure theory has been centered on the proper way to
restrict the expansion in such a way that all of the relavent physics is
maintained while extraneous information may be discarded. Such methods as
complete active space (CAS), coupled cluster (CC), multirefernce configuration
interaction (MRCI), density matrix renormalization group (DMRG),
particle--particle propagator methods (pp-RPA/TDA), and truncated CI methods may
all be described, at their core, as algorithms to provide such a filtering of
the physically relavent determinants of the CI expansion. While each of these
methods have their faults and accolades, whether it be accuracy or computational
burden, the work proposed in this work will primarily focus on CAS and MRCI
methods, which will be explained further in \cref{sec:Future}, though the
pp-RPA/TDA methods will be discussed to some extent in 
\cref{sec:pp-X2C,sec:pp-TSH}.

To properly treat the nuclear degrees of freedom, there exist a vast plethoria
of computational methods to treat the nuclear dynamics to varying degrees of
accuracy. In the proposed work, I will restrict the discussion of these methods
to only include those that are semiclassical. Semiclassical nuclear dynamics
algorithms are those that treat the nuclear motion classically (some varient of
Netwon's equations of motion) while maintaining a quantum description of the
electronic degrees if freedom. This is often a valid approach, as the nuclei of
molecules are orders of magnitude heavier than the electrons, and thus move much
slower. That is not to say that nuclei are not, strictly speaking, quantized in
their time evoluation, but rather that a large proportion of quantum effects in
full molecular dynamics are due to the time dependence of the electrons. Thus it
is usually a valid assumption that they time evolve classically relative to
their electronic counterparts. That being said, there are cases in which the
quantum evolution of the nuclei must be explicitly treated, such as tunneling in
lighter atoms, in which these semiclassical methods will not suffice to capture
the necessacary physics.

Within the semiclassical treatment of molecular dynamics, compuational methods
may be further classified as either adiabatic or non-adiabatic.
