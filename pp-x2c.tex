With the recent introduction of the particle-particle random phase and
Tamm-Dancoff approximations to \emph{ab initio} theory, routine queries of
traditionally difficult systems, such as diradicals and doubly excited states,
have been made possible. However, although a wealth of inquiry has been directed
to investigating these methods, the current formulations have been restricted to
spin-collinear systems, leaving the methods incapable of treating
non-collinearity and spin-orbit relativistic effects in excited states.  My
recent extension of the pp-TDA to two--component relativistic
Hamiltonians\cite{DBWY16_Accepted1} has helped to fill that void in the
literature.

The extension of the pp-TDA to the X2C Hamiltonian is more of a technical hurdle
than one of formalism. As
